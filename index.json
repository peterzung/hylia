[{"categories":null,"contents":"The ETA Tool is a web-app that aims to bring Calgary closer to Vision Zero (Zero casualties due to road traffic) by showing how lower speed limits can save lives while minimally impacting commute lengths. To this end, the web app projects changes in the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for commutes based on changes to speed limits on certain road segments. The tool helps Calgarians to stay better informed on how those speed limit changes would potentially affect their commutes by allowing for Calgarians to input their very own commute starting and end points.\n","permalink":"/projects/creations/etatool/","tags":null,"title":"ETA Tool"},{"categories":null,"contents":" This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026quot;contents\u0026quot;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026quot;categories\u0026quot; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
