To this end, the web app projects changes in the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for commutes based on changes to speed limits on certain road segments. The tool helps Calgarians to stay better informed on how those speed limit changes would potentially affect their commutes by allowing for Calgarians to input their very own commute starting and end points.</description></item><item><title>UAlberta AugApp</title><link>/projects/creations/augapp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/creations/augapp/</guid><description>Developed the AugApp for Android for the University of Alberta.
