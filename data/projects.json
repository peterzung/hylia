To this end, the web app projects changes in the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for commutes based on changes to speed limits on certain road segments. The tool helps Calgarians to stay better informed on how those speed limit changes would potentially affect their commutes by allowing for Calgarians to input their very own commute starting and end points.",
